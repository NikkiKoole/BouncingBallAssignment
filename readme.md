The Bouncing Ball Assignment
============================

>Use HTML5 techniques to create a 'bouncing ball' that has variable force applied by user input. It must work in desktop Chrome and in-browser on a mobile device (android and/or iOS, doesn't matter if it's phone or tablet).

This project consists of three solutions to this assignment
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Vanilla JavaScript combined with CSS3 Transitions.
2. Vanilla JavaScript and Canvas2D.
3. JavaScript and an external HTML5 library; LimeJS

The last two solutions contain extra stuff: multi ball, ball to ball collision, user draggable balls.

How to see the solutions ?
--------------------------

1. <code>download the repository as a zip (and unpack) or via git</code>
2. <code>run menu.html in Chrome</code>
3. <code>use the menu to navigate the solutions</code>

How to rebuild/edit the solutions ?
-----------------------------------
1. Get the files as described above
2. for the first 2 solutions (CSSTransition and Canvas2D) you can just edit the files as you wish, and check the results in your browser.  The last solution is more complex because LimeJS has a compiler and relies on a few extra libraries that are not in this repo:
   1. download  [LimeJS](https://github.com/digitalfruit/limejs "Title")
   2. move the balls folder into the newly created lime folder. 
   3. follow the build steps as described [here](http://www.limejs.com/7-building "Title") to create a newly compiled JS file from the edited original.

I will probably take this repository down after it has been checked.  
Wouldn't want to spoil the fun for other candidates!
