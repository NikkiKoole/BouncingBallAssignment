    <blockquote>"Use HTML5 techniques to create a 'bouncing ball' that has variable force applied by user input. It must work in desktop Chrome and in-browser on a mobile device (android and/or iOS, doesn't matter if it's phone or tablet)."</blockquote>
    <button type="button" onClick="location.href='CSSTransition/index.html';"><h1>#1</h1></br><h2>CSS Transition Ball</h2></br><p>I use CSS Transitions in this solution; because of the variable force I inject the transitions with JavaScript into the CSS3.</p></button>
        <button type="button" onClick="location.href='Canvas/index.html';"><h1>#2</h1></br><h2>Canvas2D Balls</h2></br><p>In this solution I use Canvas2D. There is an extra functionality; to add more balls into the simulation, the balls bounce against each other and die when they stop moving.</p></button>
        <button type="button" onClick="location.href='LimeJS/balls/index.html';"><h1>#3</h1></br><h2>LimeJS & Box2D Balls</h2></br><p>Here I allow myself to use external libraries to solve the assignment. I've used LimeJS (with Box2d and Google Closure).The user can drag around a finite amount of balls.</p></button>
